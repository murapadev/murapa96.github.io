If you're a developer like me who lives half your life in the terminal and the other half wrestling with large codebases, you've probably come across AI coding tools like **Cursor** and **Windsurf**. These aren’t your average Copilot clones — they promise deep repo understanding, intelligent code generation, and smoother workflows.

So, which one actually delivers?

After diving into community discussions and testing both firsthand, here’s my real-world breakdown.

---

## 🚀 Performance & Speed

**Cursor** is blazingly fast. It's built on top of VS Code, so it feels familiar but souped-up. The autocomplete is snappy, and you can roll back AI changes with a single click. That’s a life-saver when things go weird.

**Windsurf**, on the other hand, sometimes struggles with lag — especially in autocomplete. But it’s constantly improving, and for many users, the extra thinking time is worth it.

🧩 **Winner: Cursor** for speed, especially if you care about real-time responsiveness.

## 🧠 Context Awareness

This is where **Windsurf** shines. Its ability to maintain context across large projects is impressive. It feels like the AI has actually _read_ your entire repo and can reference things intelligently.

**Cursor** also does this well, especially with its **Composer** tool, which lets you orchestrate multi-step tasks. Still, a few users (myself included) have noticed some hallucinations — code that looks right but is totally off.

🧩 **Winner: Windsurf**, especially for full-feature builds and cross-file understanding.

## 🛠️ Workflow Features

- **Cursor** has a "Chat with your code" feature that's surprisingly useful, plus rollback, commit generation, and debugging assistance.
- **Windsurf** focuses more on clean integration and repo-wide code suggestions. It’s a bit more minimalist, but solid where it counts.

🧩 **Winner: Tie** — depends on whether you like more features (Cursor) or simplicity (Windsurf).

---

## 💸 Pricing

- **Cursor**: $20/month (or $16/month if paid yearly)
- **Windsurf**: $15/month

Not a huge difference, but worth noting if you're on a budget.

## 👀 Final Thoughts

| Feature          | Winner   |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| Speed            | Cursor   |
| Context Handling | Windsurf |
| Features         | Tie      |
| Pricing          | Windsurf |

If you work on fast-moving projects and want tight Git/VS Code integration, **Cursor** is a solid choice.

If you’re handling massive repos and want the AI to feel like a true pair programmer, **Windsurf** might be your jam.

Either way, these tools are reshaping the way we write code — and the best part? They're only getting better.
